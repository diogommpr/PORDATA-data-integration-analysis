# INE Data Integration and Analysis

## Overview
This project was developed as a self-initiated initiative to practice data cleaning,
integration and exploratory data analysis using public datasets from the Portuguese
National Statistics Institute (INE).

The main goal was to download multiple datasets, clean and harmonize them,
merge them into a single unified dataset, and perform exploratory analyses
to extract insights from the combined data.

## Data Sources

provided by INE.
