# INE Data Integration and Analysis

## Overview
This project was developed as a self-initiated initiative to practice data cleaning,
integration and exploratory data analysis using public datasets from the Portuguese
National Statistics Institute (INE).

The main goal was to download multiple datasets, clean and harmonize them,
merge them into a single unified dataset, and perform exploratory analyses
to extract insights from the combined data.

## Data Sources
The data used in this project were obtained from publicly available datasets
provided by INE.

Examples of datasets used:
- Dataset A: brief description (INE link)
- Dataset B: brief description (INE link)
- Dataset C: brief description (INE link)

## Methodology
The project followed these main steps:
1. Download and initial inspection of the datasets
2. Data cleaning and normalization of variables
3. Harmonization of formats and categorical values
4. Merging multiple datasets into a single database
5. Exploratory data analysis of the merged dataset

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- Jupyter Notebook
- matplotlib / seaborn

## Repository Structure
- data/raw: original datasets downloaded from INE
- data/processed: cleaned and merged datasets
- notebooks: Jupyter notebooks containing data processing and analysis steps
