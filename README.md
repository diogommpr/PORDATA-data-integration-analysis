# PORDATA Data Integration and Analysis

## Overview
This project was developed as a self-initiated initiative to practice data cleaning,
integration, and exploratory data analysis using public datasets from PORDATA, Base 
de Dados de Portugal Contemporâneo.

The main goal was to download multiple datasets, clean and harmonize them,
merge them into a single unified dataset, and perform exploratory analyses
to extract insights at the municipal level.

## Data Sources
The datasets were obtained from publicly available PORDATA databases. 

The following datasets were used: 
- Resident population by sex and age group 
- Crude mortality rate 
- Infant mortality rate 
- Crude birth rate 
- Unemployment by age group 
- Average monthly income 
- Number of pharmacies
- Crimes by category 
- Crude nuptiality rate
- Crude divorce rate

**Note:** Due to GitHub's file size limitaitons, the resident population dataset
(population_by_age_sex.csv) contains only data from 2006 onwards.

## Methodology
The project followed these main steps:

1. **Download and inspection** of all raw datasets.
2. **Data cleaning**:
   - Standardization of column names (English, removal of leading/trailing spaces, etc.).
   - Harmonization of categorical variables.
   - Removal of unnecessary columns.
3. **Dataset integration**:
   - Filtered datasets to ensure one value per municipality.
   - Created derived datasets such as total crimes per municipality.
   - Merged all datasets into a single “long” and “detailed” dataset.
4. **Exploratory data analysis**:
   - Top/bottom municipalities by key variables.
   - Normalized rates (per 1,000 inhabitants, etc.).
   - Salary quartile analysis and ANOVA tests.
   - Correlation analysis between variables.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- Jupyter Notebook
- matplotlib / seaborn
- scipy

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `01_data_cleaning.ipynb` and run all cells (Kernel → Restart & Run All):
   - Cleaned datasets will be saved in `data/processed/`.
3. Open `02_analysis.ipynb` and run all cells:
   - Analyses and plots will be generated from the processed CSVs.
4. All paths are **relative**, so the notebooks can be run from any machine without changing absolute paths.

## Notes
- Column names have been standardized in English using snake_case.
- Some datasets were filtered to totals per municipality for consistency.
- The population dataset is partial due to file size restrictions.
